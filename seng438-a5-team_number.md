# Introduction

# 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

# 

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
Two members of the team were focussing on part 1: Reliability Growth Testing. The other two focussed on part 2: Reliability Demonstration Chart. After completing both parts, our group shared the learnings with each other so that every member of the group had an equal opportunity to learn from this lab. We worked together on completing the report by dividing the parts equally. We had constant check-ins during last two weeks to ensure that everyone on the team was on same page. We collaborated using Github and communicated using a discord group chat to make sure we did the project smoothly. 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
The lab was easy to understand and follow. It was shorter than the previous labs and didn't take very long to complete. Overall, the instructions were clear and it was a good learning experience for the whole group.
